# Mono-DFCGS

Mono-DFCGS is a research codebase for a keyframe-Gaussian-only dynamic 3D Gaussian video codec built around a StreamSplat-style decoder.

The intended codec setting is:

```text
full monocular video
-> selected keyframes
-> transmitted compressed keyframe Gaussian anchors
-> decoder-side dynamic Gaussian prediction
-> reconstructed full video / dynamic 3DGS
```

The main transmitted-rate accounting is aligned with FCGS/D-FCGS/CWGS-style comparisons:

```text
total transmitted keyframe Gaussian bytes / total video frames
```

The decoder-generated intermediate Gaussians and pretrained model weights are not counted as transmitted payload by default; they should be reported separately when needed.

Project planning and operation logs are kept in:

```text
docs/KEYFRAME_GAUSSIAN_CODEC_PLAN.md
logs/QUESTIONS.md
logs/OPERATIONS.md
logs/PITFALLS.md
```

## StreamSplat Base

This repository is based on StreamSplat and will evolve toward the Mono-DFCGS codec setting above.

## Overview

StreamSplat is a fully feed-forward framework that instantly transforms uncalibrated video streams of arbitrary length into dynamic 3D Gaussian Splatting representations in an online manner.

- **Feed-forward inference**: No per-scene optimization required
- **Camera-free**: Works directly with uncalibrated monocular videos
- **Dynamic scene modeling**: Handles both static and dynamic scene elements through polynomial motion modeling
- **Probabilistic Gaussian prediction**: Uses truncated Gaussian models for robust Gaussian position modeling
- **Two-stage training**: Stage 1 trains the static encoder, Stage 2 trains the dynamic decoder

## Environment Setup

1. **Create conda environment:**

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate StreamSplat
```

2. **Build the differentiable Gaussian rasterizer:**

```bash
cd submodules/diff-gaussian-rasterization-orth
pip install .
```

3. **Download pretrained depth model:**

Download Depth Anything V2 checkpoint and place it in the `checkpoints/` directory:

```bash
mkdir -p checkpoints
# Download depth_anything_v2_vitl.pth from https://github.com/DepthAnything/Depth-Anything-V2
# Place it in checkpoints/depth_anything_v2_vitl.pth
```

## Dataset Preparation

StreamSplat supports training on multiple datasets. All datasets require pre-computed depth maps using Depth Anything V2.

### Supported Datasets

| Dataset | Type | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| [RealEstate10K](https://google.github.io/realestate10k/) | Static | Real estate videos |
| [CO3Dv2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/co3d) | Static | Object-centric multi-view |
| [DAVIS](https://davischallenge.org/) | Dynamic | High-quality videos |
| [YouTube-VOS](https://youtube-vos.org/) | Dynamic | Large-scale videos |

### Preprocessing Depth Maps

Use the provided script to preprocess depth maps for DAVIS (similar scripts can be adapted for other datasets):

```bash
python preprocess_depth_davis.py --root_path /path/to/davis
```

### Configure Dataset Paths

Edit `configs/options.py` and `configs/options_decoder.py` to set dataset paths:

```python
root_path_re10k: str = "/path/to/re10k"
root_path_co3d: str = "/path/to/co3d"
root_path_davis: str = "/path/to/davis"
root_path_vos: str = "/path/to/youtube-vos"
```

## Training

### Configure Accelerate

Create an accelerate config file (or use the provided `acc_configs/gpu8.yaml`):

```bash
accelerate config
```

### Stage 1: Train Static Encoder

Train the static encoder on combined datasets:

```bash
accelerate launch --config_file acc_configs/gpu8.yaml train.py combined \
    --workspace /path/to/workspace/encoder_exp
```

### Stage 2: Train Dynamic Decoder

After Stage 1 completes, train the dynamic decoder with the frozen encoder:

```bash
accelerate launch --config_file acc_configs/gpu8.yaml train_decoder.py combined \
    --workspace /path/to/workspace/decoder_exp \
    --encoder_path /path/to/workspace/encoder_exp/model.safetensors
```

### Monitoring Training

Training progress is logged to [Weights & Biases](https://wandb.ai/). Set up wandb before training:

```bash
wandb login
```

Checkpoints are saved every 10 epochs and every 30 minutes to `checkpoint_latest/`.

## Inference

Download our pretrained checkpoint at [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1miH90t-hTwxfv0lc876_x1Xc7ZkoOFCY?usp=share_link) and place it in the `checkpoints/` directory:

```bash
python splat_inference.py \
    --resume checkpoints/streamsplat.safetensors \
    --input_frames_path=/path/to/rgb_frames \
    --input_depths_path=/path/to/depth_maps
```
